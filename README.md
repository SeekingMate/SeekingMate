# Seeking Mate

Freesome is the 1st product from the Seeking Mate series - the second product is called Soul Mate and it's meat for serious long-term mating (at Seeking Mate we don't use the word marriage).

## Freesome - Born out of Desire by Seeking Mate

Fair play and fashionable sex date app for everyone.

General Ideas:

* One pairing chance per week, if you miss it, you miss it: this is the key idea behind non-biasing mating
* Each propose then pay half the hotel price - yes, first time contact must happen within a hotel, and we take 1%
* Basic profile data: Gender, Age, Ethinity, Height, Weight, Profession, Most Active Region, Profile Color, Blood Test Result Availability and Date, Sex Experience
	* Will not allow editing of: Profile photo, profile background image, or any other self-identifying information
* Absolutely no communication before sex happens.
* (System Computed) (Average Satisfaction) Ratings

System Features:

* Awards: First night on us, 
* Achievements: First Time User, Ten Standings, 1 Year Anniversary, Pick Up Artist, N-week Strike, Party Lover (join successfuly Party Mode once)
* Session Ratings: each person will rate 1 to 5 based on - overall satisfaction, sex/sexuality, intimacy, style
* Enrolling: All matching happens at midnight every Thursday night toronto time - one must enroll in the pool to find a match. There are those options available when enrolling in drawing pool: Duel (MF, MM, FF) or Threesome (MMM, MMF, MFF, FFF) or Party (2-5, 6-10, >10; Will have free Pizza offered on the house), Participating Region per Pool Region, and optionally Preferred Ethinity/Age/Height/Weight/Profession/Blood Test Result range/availability (choose All to maximize chance of match). There are simultaneously 4 pools but one can choose to join only one pool: Preferred City, Preferred Greater Manipucipality Area, Preferred Province, Preferred Country. One can choose its pool and preferences before the draw time. 1 hour before and after the draw time, the system will be closed for enrollment. After the draw, one will be assigned 1 or 2 partners from the pool (s)he particupates in. Then each one can propose the exact hotel and time (available range from upcoming Friday night to next Thursday night) to meet up for their night. When everyone agrees, the deal is made and each one should make equal payments. Then it's the day for sex! No one will know the identity of the other until the datetime of sex. From this scheme, the first time people met it must be paid and through a hotel - this is to create a barrier of entry
* Algorithm generated (not guaranteed) best match maximizing average satiafaction score (will only work with larger samples) - it's a single metric instead of based on customized personal preferences
* Always show how many people are currently in pool and how many are registered users

### Design Language

* Green for vibrant color

## Soul Mate

Based on the hypothesis that there MUST be someone like us across the world, we aim to search ACROSS THE GLOBE to find the true love of our life - one love for one life. Soul Mate is not a light-hearted dating app, it's meant to find our ultimate destiny. The fundamental mechanism is based on two parts: 1) Interest matching; 2) Getting to know each other.

### Philosophy

We believe that it's equally important for two people to have a shared goal and interest in order to start a relationship, and for the two to have ongoing communication and interaction to truely develop a bond. A soul mate is not built in one encountering nor computed by an algorithm - ultimately it's the human collections that forges The True Love.

## Legality

Apparently sex related products are deemed inappropriate in most stores and countries. Seeking Mate is not-for-profit (pending registration as an organization/incorporation yet) and all contents are open-source. Release packages will simply be published on Github before we find better places to host them.
